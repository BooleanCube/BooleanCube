*only 1 released atm, im working on more*

#### Tools:
I use Intellij for large java projects in which I require to use external libraries like discord bots, etc. However, I like to use neovim for competitive programming and for any light programming really like for competitive programming, because it is very fast and not bloated and is a text editor, rather than an IDE with a lot of nice plugins. I also use Visual Studio 2019 Community while programming in C# for my unity games. Unity collaborated with microsoft to create their own IDE which is very useful for debugging Unity games and I find it really useful. There are ways to set up neovim for Unity Game Development as well, there are tutorials online. My neovim config files are in my dotfiles repository in the init.vim file. I also use the alacritty terminal emulator with neovim, just because it comes in handy in a lot of cases with neovim and its a lot fast as well and even less bloated compared to other terminal emulators. The microsoft terminal emulator is also a good choice but it is more bloated.
