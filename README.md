### ABOUT MEEEEE:
*(in one big paragraph)*<br>
I make many typos. I procrastinate a lot. I used to speedrun rubix cubes, A LOT! I am a swimmer and a black belt martial artist, and I do competitive sparring. I am a competitive programmer and a game developer working on a few games. I do discord and twitch bot dev sometimes. I am an environmentalist. i am very lazy. space/astrophysics enthusiast and love astronomy. i like forensic science as well. my favorite series by far is probably sherlock holmes. i dont really watch many movies. im a very busy guy. I hate biology as a course. i have short term memory loss (just a joke but its true i have terrible memory). im better at java than I am at english, my high school grades can prove that.
